# CCNA Cisco Packet Tracer Labs

Hands-on CCNA labs using Cisco Packet Tracer to build practical understanding of networking concepts.

## Week 1 – Switching Basics

### Topics

* Basic connectivity (PC ↔ PC)
* LAN setup using switches
* Multi-switch topologies
* Telnet and SSH access

### Key Learnings

* Connectivity verification using ping
* Switch forwarding using MAC address tables
* Difference between Telnet (insecure) and SSH (secure)

## Week 2 – VTP & VLAN Management

### Topics

* VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
* VTP Server mode
* VTP Client mode
* VTP Transparent mode
* Trunk link configuration
* VLAN propagation across switches
* Access port VLAN assignment

### Key Learnings

* VTP simplifies VLAN management in multi-switch networks
* Server mode distributes VLAN updates
* Client mode receives synchronized VLAN data
* Transparent mode forwards VTP advertisements while maintaining local VLAN control
* Trunk links are essential for VTP communication

## Week 3 – DTP, STP & EtherChannel

### Topics

* Dynamic Trunking Protocol (Auto / Desirable)
* Manual trunk configuration
* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
* Root Bridge Priority configuration
* STP port roles (Root, Designated, Alternate)
* EtherChannel configuration using LACP
* Link aggregation between switches

### Key Learnings

* DTP automates trunk formation between switches
* STP prevents loops in redundant Layer 2 networks
* Root bridge determines the path for traffic flow
* Non-root switches block redundant links to avoid loops
* EtherChannel bundles multiple links into one logical link
* LACP ensures dynamic and reliable link aggregation
* EtherChannel removes STP blocking on bundled links and improves bandwidth utilization

## Week 4 – Routing Protocols

### Topics

* Static Routing
* RIP Configuration
* OSPF Configuration
* EIGRP Configuration
* Serial WAN connections between routers
* Route verification using routing tables
* End-to-end connectivity testing

### Key Learnings

* Static routing manually defines packet forwarding paths
* RIP dynamically shares routes using hop count metric
* OSPF uses areas and wildcard masks for efficient routing
* EIGRP provides fast convergence and advanced route selection
* Routing tables help verify learned and connected networks
* Different routing protocols are identified using:

  * S → Static
  * R → RIP
  * O → OSPF
  * D → EIGRP
* Successful ping responses confirm inter-network communication

## Week 5 – DHCP, OSPF & NTP Configuration

### Topics

* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
* OSPF multi-router routing
* Network Time Protocol (NTP)
* Multi-router WAN topology
* Automatic IP assignment
* Time synchronization between routers
* End-to-end connectivity verification

### Key Learnings

* DHCP automates IP address assignment for end devices
* OSPF dynamically exchanges routes between interconnected routers
* OSPF neighbor relationships enable scalable routing
* NTP synchronizes time across all routers in the network
* Proper routing must exist before NTP synchronization works
* WAN links enable communication between multiple LAN networks
* Connectivity can be verified using ping and routing tables
